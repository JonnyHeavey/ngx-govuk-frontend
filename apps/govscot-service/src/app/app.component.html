<h2>Basic Accordion Example</h2>

  <ngx-govscot-accordion-item

    <p>
      Corporation Tax is charged on the 'chargeable profits' of limited
      companies, members' clubs, societies, associations, co-operatives and
      other unincorporated bodies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rate of Corporation Tax depends on the amount of profit your company
      makes and when your accounting period ends.
    </p>
  </ngx-govscot-accordion-item>

  <ngx-govscot-accordion-item
    itemId="section-2"
    heading="Who must pay"
    summary="Companies, clubs and societies"
  >
    <p>
      You must pay Corporation Tax if your company or organisation is based in
      the UK or has an office or branch here.

    <ul>
      <li>limited companies</li>

    <p>

      <li>buy business stock or equipment</li>
      <li>take on employees</li>
      <li>rent or buy business premises</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You have 3 months from when you start doing business to tell HMRC. You
      could be fined if you do not register in time.

    <p>
      You can register your company for Corporation Tax online using the
      Government Gateway.
    </p>
    <h3>What you'll need</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>your company registration number</li>
      <li>the date you started doing business</li>
      <li>your contact details</li>
      <li>details of your business activities</li>
    </ul>
