## API

### Inputs

| Input   | Type     | Default    | Description                                        |

### Content Projection

## Design System Guidelines

### When to use this component

- To tell users when they complete a task they started, such as submitting a form
- On confirmation pages after successful task completion
- To display important completion information prominently

### When not to use this component

- If a page still has further actions a user can take
- When further form fields remain on the page after submitting changes
- For error messages or warnings (use appropriate error components instead)

### Placement and Usage Rules

- **Place at the top of the main content**, either as the page's main heading or immediately after it
- **Only use one notification panel per page**
- **Keep titles short** and high-level explanations of what has happened
- **Do not include buttons or links** in the notification panel's content
- **Use shorter words** to limit text wrapping on small devices

## Accessibility

The notification panel component is designed with accessibility in mind:

### Heading Structure

- Uses `<h1>` element for the title when used as the page's main heading
- If the page already has an H1 heading, use a different heading level for the notification panel's title
- The notification panel's title will look the same regardless of the heading level used

### Dynamic Content

- Add `role="alert"` to notification panels you add to the page dynamically
- This helps screen readers tell users about the change to the page

```html
<ngx-govscot-notification-panel title="Form saved" role="alert">
  <p>Your form has been automatically saved.</p>
</ngx-govscot-notification-panel>
```

### Semantic Structure

- Uses proper semantic HTML structure
- Maintains contrast ratios for accessibility
- Screen reader friendly content organization

## Design System Compliance

This component follows the Scottish Government Design System specifications:

- Uses the `ds_notification-panel` base class
- Implements `ds_notification-panel__title` for the heading
- Uses `ds_notification-panel__content` for the content area
- Follows the exact HTML structure from the design system examples
- Maintains consistent spacing and typography

## Architecture

This component extends the core `NotificationPanelDirective` from `@ngx-uk-frontend/core/notification-panel`, allowing for shared functionality between different design system implementations while maintaining design system-specific styling and behavior.

```typescript
// Core directive provides shared functionality
export class NotificationPanelDirective {
  readonly title = input.required<string>();
}

// Scottish Government implementation
export class GovScotNotificationPanelComponent extends NotificationPanelDirective {}
```
