        component: `
A highlight block that shows the user important information after they have completed a task, such as a success message.

Based on the Scottish Government Design System, notification panels present important content when a task completes. Use them on confirmation pages to tell users both that they have completed the thing they wanted to do and the outcome.

## When to use this component

- To tell users when they complete a task they started, such as submitting a form
- On confirmation pages after successful task completion
- To display important completion information prominently

## When not to use this component

- If a page still has further actions a user can take
- When further form fields remain on the page after submitting changes
- For error messages or warnings (use appropriate error components instead)

## Design System Guidelines

- Place at the top of the main content, either as the page's main heading or immediately after it
- Only use one notification panel per page
- Keep titles short and high-level explanations of what has happened
- Do not include buttons or links in the notification panel's content
- For dynamic panels, add \`role="alert"\` to help screen readers

## Accessibility

- Uses H1 heading for the title when used as page's main heading
- Can use different heading levels if page already has H1
- Supports \`role="alert"\` for dynamically added panels
- Maintains proper semantic structure
